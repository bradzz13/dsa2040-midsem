## 1. Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the DSA2040 Mid-Semester examination.  
The objective was to **extract** and **transform** a raw dataset to prepare it for further analytics and visualization.  

The tasks include:
- Importing and exploring the dataset
- Cleaning and handling missing values
- Standardizing data types and column names
- Creating new derived fields
- Exporting transformed data for future analysis


## 2. Data Source
Dataset provided via course materials.

**Description:**
- Contains records relevant to the exam dataset
- Includes multiple variables for processing, cleaning, and transformation
- Used to demonstrate core ET concepts
